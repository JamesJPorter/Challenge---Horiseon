# <Efficient-Horiseon>

## Description

In this brief Refactoring exercise I have cut down on at least two dozen lines of unncessary code and made the Horiseon landing page both more accessible for the end user and more editable for any future coders working on the project. 

- To clean up the code, increase efficiency and increase accessibility. 
- I built this project to practice my code recognition and refining skills while also producing a better 
- This project made the code readable. 
- I learned how to make my code D.R.Y.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
